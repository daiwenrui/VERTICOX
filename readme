The source code implements VERTICOX with one server and two servers. The default dataset loaded is UARU dataset as shown in the paper. Folders "Estimation" and "Analysis" include the source codes for model parameter estimation and survival analysis, respectively. 

The source code is successfully compiled in Julia 0.4.7. To run the source code, please configure the server and client as follow.

For model parameter estimation
1. Server: Configure "DemoServer.jl" in folder "Server"
 - In "NETWORK", input your serverIP, msgPort and dataPort
 - In "users", input userID, username, and password
 - In "tasks", input taskID for userID
 - In "currentTask", input taskID and taskName
 - In "ParaInServer", input maxit(max_iteration_number) and tol (tolerance of error)
2. Clients: Configure "DemoClient.jl" and "DemoClient2.jl" in folders "Client" and "Client2"
 - Use the same NETWORK and USER as server side
 - Use the full path to get local data X (i.e. uaru.txt includes covariates, time and censor) and beta1b (para.txt includes model parameter for centralized realization)
 
For survival analysis
Besides similar configuration as model parameter estimation,
1. Server: Survival curve and AUC score are output to Surv.txt and AUC.txt in folder "Analysis/Server"
2. Clients: Also use the full path to get test data Xnew, e.g. uaru_test.txt for UARU test data.
